        "body": "These guidelines from the World Health Organization (WHO) focus on HIV prevention using lenacapavir (LEN), a long-acting injectable pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and the associated testing strategies.  The document emphasizes offering LEN as an additional HIV prevention choice, alongside existing options like oral PrEP and long-acting injectable cabotegravir (CABLA).\n\n**Key Recommendations:**\n\n*   **LEN as an Additional PrEP Choice:**  The guidelines strongly recommend offering six-monthly injectable LEN as an additional prevention option for people at risk of HIV, as part of a comprehensive prevention approach. This recommendation is based on moderate to high certainty evidence regarding LEN's safety and efficacy.\n*   **Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs) for HIV Testing:** The guidelines strongly recommend using HIV RDTs for HIV testing when initiating, continuing, or discontinuing long-acting PrEP. This recommendation aims to simplify testing, reduce barriers, and improve access to PrEP, particularly in resource-limited settings.\n\n**Rationale and Supporting Evidence:**\n\n*   **Efficacy of LEN:** Clinical trials (PURPOSE 1 and PURPOSE 2) demonstrated that LEN significantly reduced HIV acquisition compared to background HIV incidence and daily oral PrEP.\n*   **Safety of LEN:**  The overall rate of adverse events was similar between LEN and oral PrEP, with injection site reactions (ISRs) being the most common side effect.\n*   **Cost-Effectiveness:**  Mathematical modeling suggests that LEN could be cost-effective, especially in settings with high HIV prevalence, if the annual per-person cost remains below certain thresholds.\n*   **Equity and Human Rights:**  Offering LEN as an additional option is expected to increase equity by accommodating different user needs and preferences. The six-monthly dosing schedule may reduce barriers associated with frequent clinic visits.\n*   **RDTs vs. NAT:**  RDTs offer faster turnaround times and lower costs compared to nucleic acid testing (NAT), making them more feasible for widespread implementation.\n\n**Implementation Considerations:**\n\n*   **Dosing and Administration:**  LEN involves an oral loading dose followed by subcutaneous injections every 26 weeks.\n*   **Service Delivery:**  Differentiated service delivery models, including task sharing and community-based delivery, are crucial for achieving scale-up and creating person-centered services.\n*   **Hepatitis and STIs:**  Testing for hepatitis B and",

        "body": "This document summarizes the World Health Organization's (WHO) recommendations for managing sickle cell disease (SCD) during pregnancy, childbirth, and the interpregnancy period.  SCD, a group of inherited blood disorders, poses significant risks to pregnant women and their babies, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The guideline aims to provide evidence-based recommendations to improve maternal and perinatal outcomes.\n\n**Guideline Development:** The recommendations were developed using a rigorous process involving systematic reviews of evidence, expert consultations, and consideration of values, equity, and feasibility. A Guideline Development Group (GDG) comprising international experts formulated the recommendations based on the best available evidence, considering the balance of benefits and harms, resource implications, and the perspectives of women with SCD.\n\n**Key Recommendations:** The guideline provides 21 recommendations covering various aspects of SCD management during pregnancy:\n\n*   **Medication Management:** Folic acid supplementation is recommended for all pregnant women with SCD, with dosage adjustments for those taking intermittent preventive treatment for malaria. Iron supplementation is advised only for women with documented iron deficiency. Prophylactic blood transfusions may be considered for women with a history of severe SCD crises. Continuation or recommencement of hydroxycarbamide after the first trimester may be considered in shared decision-making. Thromboprophylaxis should be considered for non-hospitalized pregnant women with SCD and additional risk factors for thromboembolism. Routine infection prophylaxis and screening for infections like urinary tract infections are advised.\n*   **Pain Management:** Timely and optimal pain relief should be offered for acute sickle-related pain, considering various analgesia options (paracetamol, NSAIDs, opioids) at the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration. Individualized pain management plans should be developed early in pregnancy.\n*   **Fluid Management:**  Frequent clinical monitoring is crucial for pregnant women with SCD hospitalized with vaso-occlusive crises requiring intravenous fluid hydration to identify fluid overload.\n*   **Thromboprophylaxis:** Thromboprophylaxis is recommended for hospitalized pregnant women with SCD unless contraindicated.\n*   **Fetal Monitoring:**  Growth scans are recommended every four weeks between 24 and 32 weeks' gestation, and every three weeks until birth, for women without complications. Individualized, intensive fetal monitoring is advised for women with complications.\n*   **Timing and Mode of Birth:** The timing of birth should be individualized, balancing fetal maturation with the",

        "body": "This Global Evidence Review on Health Migration (GEHM) examines health system strengthening interventions that improve the health of displaced migrant populations in the context of climate change. It acknowledges that climate change is an increasing driver of migration and displacement, which are key determinants of health and well-being. The review aims to identify and analyze existing evidence on health system interventions designed to address the health needs of climate-affected displaced migrants, ultimately providing policymakers with actionable strategies to strengthen health systems and enhance care delivery for this vulnerable population.\n\nThe review focuses on six key building blocks of health systems: governance, health financing, health workforce, medicines and supplies, health information systems, and service delivery. It analyzes 95 health system interventions identified from peer-reviewed and grey literature published between January 2014 and June 2024. The interventions are categorized based on the health system building block they primarily address, the type of climate hazard they respond to, and whether they are primarily focused on climate adaptation or mitigation.\n\nThe results show that the majority of interventions (53) focus on service delivery, particularly in the context of climate-related emergencies, including provision of health, immunization, mental health services, and access to safe water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH). Governance and health workforce interventions constitute 37% of the total, primarily focusing on inclusion of climate-affected migrants in policy and governance, and enhancing the capacity of the health workforce. Health financing, medicine supplies, and health information systems are less represented. A small number of interventions explicitly include climate mitigation strategies.\n\nThe review identifies strengths, limitations, and research gaps. Strengths include the comprehensive identification and categorization of interventions. Limitations include the focus on English language literature, potential bias in intervention classification, and variability in migration terminology. Key research gaps include the scarcity of long-term, proactive interventions, limited evidence on climate mitigation strategies within health systems, and underrepresentation of certain health system building blocks and geographical regions.\n\nThe review concludes with policy considerations for strengthening health systems to better address the health needs of displaced migrant populations in the context of climate change. These include: adopting a whole-of-route approach to support continuity of care; integrating essential public health functions and health system resilience considerations; ensuring inclusion and engagement of displaced migrants in policy planning and delivery; addressing knowledge gaps through research; and shifting towards proactive, long-term strategies for designing migrant-inclusive, climate-resilient health systems.

        "body": "This document is a guideline from the World Health Organization (WHO) for managing asymptomatic sexually transmitted infections (STIs). It addresses the high global burden of STIs, highlighting that many infections are asymptomatic, posing a challenge to control efforts. The guideline aims to provide evidence-informed recommendations for screening asymptomatic individuals, specifically for *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* and *Chlamydia trachomatis*, to support countries in developing national STI management guidelines and achieving global health targets by 2030.\n\nThe target audience includes policymakers, program managers, healthcare workers, and public health professionals involved in planning and implementing STI services. It also targets non-governmental and community-based organizations, including those working with key populations affected by HIV.\n\nThe guideline development followed a rigorous methodology, including systematic reviews, modeling, and the GRADE approach to assess evidence and formulate recommendations. A Guideline Development Group reviewed the evidence and made recommendations, while an External Review Group provided peer review. Conflicts of interest were managed transparently.\n\nKey recommendations include conditional recommendations for screening *N. gonorrhoeae* and *C. trachomatis* in pregnant women, sexually active adolescents and young people, sex workers, and men who have sex with men (MSM) who are asymptomatic and accessing healthcare services, provided that local prevalence is high and resources are available. The recommendations emphasize that screening should be voluntary, with informed consent, and linked to treatment and partner notification. The guideline also highlights the importance of using quality-assured diagnostic tests and following national treatment guidelines.\n\nImplementation considerations include defining screening, establishing the rationale and objectives for screening programs, addressing ethical considerations, selecting appropriate diagnostic tests, and ensuring early and effective treatment. The guideline stresses the need to integrate screening with other prevention interventions and to adapt services to meet the specific needs of key populations.\n\nThe guideline will be disseminated through the WHO website, regional offices, and partner organizations. A user feedback system will be established to monitor the guideline's utility and identify areas for future updates. The document also identifies research needs, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, to address gaps in evidence and improve the effectiveness and sustainability of STI screening programs.\n",
