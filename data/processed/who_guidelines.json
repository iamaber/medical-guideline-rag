        "title": "Lenacapavir for HIV prevention and testing strategies",
        "body": "These guidelines, published by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2025, focus on the use of lenacapavir (LEN), a long-acting injectable antiretroviral, for HIV prevention (PrEP) and the associated HIV testing strategies. They aim to support countries in achieving national targets for reducing new HIV infections by providing evidence-informed recommendations for the use of LEN PrEP and simplified HIV testing algorithms.\n\n**Key Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **LEN as an Additional PrEP Option:** The guidelines strongly recommend offering six-monthly injectable LEN as an additional prevention choice for individuals at risk of HIV, as part of a comprehensive combination prevention approach. This recommendation is based on moderate to high certainty evidence regarding LEN's safety and efficacy in reducing HIV acquisition, as demonstrated in clinical trials.\n2.  **Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs) for HIV Testing:** The guidelines strongly recommend the use of HIV RDTs for HIV testing during the initiation, continuation, and discontinuation of long-acting PrEP. This recommendation acknowledges the feasibility, acceptability, and cost-effectiveness of RDTs compared to more complex and costly laboratory-based nucleic acid testing (NAT).\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n*   **LEN PrEP:** LEN offers a long-acting alternative to daily oral PrEP, potentially improving adherence and uptake, especially for individuals who struggle with taking daily pills or prefer less frequent clinic visits. Clinical trials have shown LEN to be highly effective in reducing HIV acquisition.\n*   **Simplified HIV Testing:** Using RDTs simplifies the testing process, reduces barriers to access, minimizes delays, and improves the sustainability of PrEP programs. This approach is particularly important in resource-limited settings where NAT capacity is often scarce.\n\n**Implementation Considerations:**\n\n*   **Differentiated Service Delivery:** Successful LEN implementation requires differentiated service delivery models, including task sharing, community-based delivery, and leveraging virtual interventions.\n*   **Integration with Existing Services:** LEN PrEP should be integrated with other HIV prevention and sexual health services, such as STI screening and treatment, contraception, and mental health support.\n*   **Community Engagement:** Meaningful community participation is essential in designing, implementing, and monitoring LEN PrEP programs.\n*   **Cost-Effectiveness:** While LEN is likely cost-effective in the long term, large-scale implementation may require significant resources. Countries should consider the relative cost-benefit of introducing LEN and negotiate the lowest possible price.\n*   **Monitoring and Surveillance:** Robust monitoring systems are needed to track LEN initiation, persistence, safety, adverse events, and drug resistance.\n\n**Research Gaps:**\n\nThe guidelines highlight several research gaps that need to be addressed to optimize LEN PrEP implementation, including:\n\n*   Optimal HIV testing strategies and frequency\n*   The role of HIV self-testing in long-acting PrEP delivery\n*   Alternative injection sites and dosing schedules\n*   Service delivery models for specific",

        "body": "This document summarizes the World Health Organization's (WHO) recommendations for managing sickle cell disease (SCD) during pregnancy, childbirth, and the interpregnancy period. It is intended for healthcare providers, policymakers, and program managers, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where SCD prevalence is high. The guideline development followed a rigorous process, including evidence synthesis, quality assessment using GRADE methodology, and formulation of recommendations based on an evidence-to-decision (EtD) framework.\n\nThe recommendations address various aspects of care, including medication management (folic acid, iron, hydroxycarbamide, thromboprophylaxis, infection prophylaxis), pain management, fluid management, thromboprophylaxis for hospitalized women, fetal monitoring, timing and mode of birth, and interpregnancy care. Due to limited direct evidence, many recommendations are based on physiological understanding, expert opinion, and evidence from general populations, with careful consideration of benefits, harms, values, resource use, equity, human rights, acceptability, and feasibility.\n\nKey recommendations include:\n\n*   **Folic acid supplementation:** Continue daily supplementation of 5mg outside malaria-endemic areas; 400µg daily if taking intermittent preventive treatment (IPTp) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine.\n*   **Iron supplementation:** Only if iron deficiency is present.\n*   **Hydroxycarbamide:** Consider continuation or recommencement after the first trimester, with shared decision-making.\n*   **Thromboprophylaxis:** Consider for non-hospitalized women with additional risk factors. Offer to all hospitalized pregnant women with SCD unless contraindicated.\n*   **Fetal monitoring:** Growth scans every four weeks from 24-32 weeks, then every three weeks until birth for uncomplicated pregnancies; individualized intensive monitoring for complicated pregnancies.\n*   **Timing of birth:** Individualized approach based on the balance of fetal maturation and maternal/neonatal risks.\n*   **Mode of birth:** Vaginal birth is preferable in the absence of medical or obstetric indications for Cesarean section.\n*   **Interpregnancy care:** Comprehensive postnatal care, management of SCD complications, contraception counseling, newborn screening, and breastfeeding guidance.\n\nThe document emphasizes the importance of a woman-centered approach, shared decision-making, and multidisciplinary care. It also highlights the need for education and training of healthcare providers, addressing stigma, and integrating SCD care across the life course.\n\nThe WHO encourages dissemination and implementation of these guidelines at national and local levels, with adaptation to specific contexts. Monitoring and evaluation of implementation are crucial to assess the impact on maternal and newborn health outcomes. The document also identifies key research gaps, particularly in areas where direct evidence is lacking.\n",

        "body": "This Global Evidence Review on Health Migration (GEHM) focuses on health system strengthening interventions to improve the health of displaced migrant populations in the context of climate change. It acknowledges the increasing role of climate change as a driver of migration and displacement, exacerbating existing health vulnerabilities and straining health systems.\n\nThe review analyzes 95 health system interventions identified from peer-reviewed and grey literature (2014-2024), categorized using the WHO's six health system building blocks: governance, health financing, health workforce, medicines and supplies, health information systems, and service delivery. The majority of interventions (53) focused on service delivery, particularly in climaterelated emergencies, including provision of health, immunization, mental health, and WASH services. Governance and health workforce interventions constituted 37% of the total, emphasizing policy inclusion of climate-affected migrants and capacity building for healthcare workers. Health financing, medicine supplies, and health information systems were less represented.\n\nKey findings include:\n\n*   **Coordination is crucial:** Interventions demonstrate extensive coordination among humanitarian organizations, governments, academics, the private sector, and community members.\n*   **Innovation is emerging:** Innovative interventions are emerging, and existing interventions are being adapted to be migrant-inclusive and climate-resilient. Examples include mobile mental health applications, climate-resilient technologies in healthcare facilities, and expedited health insurance coverage for displaced populations.\n*   **Adaptation is prioritized:** Most interventions focused on climate adaptation (89%), with only a few explicitly including climate mitigation strategies.\n\nThe review identifies several research gaps:\n\n*   **Long-term interventions:** A scarcity of long-term, proactive interventions addressing the health needs of displaced populations.\n*   **Climate mitigation:** Limited evidence on interventions integrating climate mitigation strategies within health systems.\n*   **Health system-wide approaches:** Underrepresentation of health system-wide approaches that cut across multiple building blocks.\n*   **Geographical representation:** Underrepresentation of interventions in certain regions, particularly Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific, despite their vulnerability to climate change impacts.\n*   **Effectiveness evaluation:** A need for thorough research on the effectiveness, sustainability, and impact of implemented interventions.\n\nPolicy considerations based on the review findings include:\n\n*   **Meaningful inclusion:** Ensure meaningful inclusion and engagement of displaced migrant populations in policy planning and delivery.\n*   **Address knowledge gaps:** Address knowledge gaps in health system strengthening interventions in the context of migration and climate change.\n*   **Proactive long-term strategies:** Shift towards proactive, long-term strategies in designing and planning health systems that are migrant-inclusive and climate-resilient.\n*   **Whole-of-route approach:** Move towards a whole-of-route approach to support continuity of care for migrants.\n*   **Beyond building blocks:** Think beyond health system building blocks by integrating essential public health functions and health system resilience considerations.\n\n",
